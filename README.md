This was the first big project that I made in React. After finishing the React part of Stephen Grider's (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) "Modern React with Redux" course. I wanted to make a project to polish my skills before diving into Redux, so I started searching only for interesting free API's that I could make use of. Finally, I came across Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/). After reading their documentation I decided that I wanted to make weather app that I would actually use. The two tasks that the app had to accomplish were: it would have to tell you the actual temperature of the city that you wanted, and it would have to create a graph with the forecast data for today and the following days (on the documentation it says that it allows forecast data for 10 days in advance but the response only contains 3 days, no matter the parameters that you pass). Later I also though it would be nice if the background color changed depending on if it was day or night in the selected city. So I added the feature.
Note: now I refactored the code to make it more legible and I implemented Redux to manage the pieces of state that are used in more than one components. (https://github.com/LucasPennice/React-ReduxWeatherApp)
